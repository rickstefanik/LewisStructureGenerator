# LewisStructureGenerator
Matlab project that creates 3D models of Lewis Structures to allow for visualizations not possible with a textbook.  To run the program, execute SampleGUI.m.  When viewing a 3D structure, make sure to hit the rotate 3D button in the toolbar to explore the geometry of the compound.  Made as Introduction to Engineering final project with Ryan Cove, Danielle Koterbay, Elizabeth Innis, and Kristine Nguyen.
